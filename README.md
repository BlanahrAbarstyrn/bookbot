# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This is a simple Python program that takes in a path to a book in .txt format from the command line
and returns a report with word count of the document. It also includes a list of each character that
appears in the document along with the number of times it appears.

This guided project helped to reinforce lessons learned in Learn to Code in Python,
Learn Linux, and Learn Git.

This guided project is Course 4 called Build a Bookbot.
